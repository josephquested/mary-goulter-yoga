      I love yoga! I know that life can be difficult -
      my practice has taught how to face these difficulties
      and find not only the strength to bear them but also how
      to face fully all of lifeâ€™s experiences, from the joyful
      to the mundane. I know the value of a consistent practice, and I am honoured
      to share this with you. <br><br> I found yoga while living in San Francisco,
      and have been fortunate enough to study with incredibly kind and
      intelligent teachers. I bring a compassionate and encouraging presence
      to my classes, and aim to make my teaching relevant and meaningful to everybody.
